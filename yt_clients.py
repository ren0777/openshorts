"""yt-dlp client selection for YouTube, shared by the download (``main.py``)
and the duration probe (``cloud/metering.py``) so the two cannot drift.

Why the client list is explicit. With account cookies yt-dlp's defaults are
``tv_downgraded`` + ``web``, and for a share of videos both come back
UNPLAYABLE / SABR-only, which surfaces as "Video unavailable" with no
formats. That looked like an IP ban (it also happened on every static ISP IP)
and for a week sent ~26 downloads a week to the per-GB proxy, which then
downloaded 360p through the same dead client list. Measured on 6-sep-2026
inside the prod container, same static proxy, same video:

    cookies + default clients            -> Video unavailable
    cookies + mweb (+ PO token)          -> 1080p
    no cookies + default clients         -> 1080p
    cookies + default,mweb (+ PO token)  -> 1080p (also on a video that worked)

``mweb`` needs a GVS PO token for its https formats, which the bgutil
provider mints as long as the webpage is NOT skipped (``player_skip:
webpage`` drops the account's Data Sync ID and the token request fails).
The old fallback list (``tv_embed``, ``android``) is gone from yt-dlp: the
first is "unsupported", the second is skipped whenever cookies are present.

    A search page, a bare playlist, a channel or a hashtag is walked entry by

    ``list=`` off a ``watch`` link). Measured in the prod container on
    17-sep-2026: a ``results?search_query=`` URL held the probe's executor
    thread for 2220 s and still failed on an entry that "premieres in 4 days",

    check is by path, up front and free: nothing that is not one video is
