"""Small, dependency-free SSRF guards shared by the download / scrape paths.

The app fetches user-supplied URLs server-side (yt-dlp downloads, SaaS landing
page scraping, actor-image download). Without a guard, a caller can point those
at internal services or the cloud metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254) to read
instance credentials. ``assert_public_url`` rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes and any
host that resolves to anything but a globally routable address (private,
loopback, link-local, reserved, and the 100.64.0.0/10 range Tailscale uses).
