<h2>What "auto clip" does, step by step</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transcribe.</strong> The audio is transcribed with word-level timestamps, so every clip can start and end on a word.</li>
<li><strong>Find the cuts.</strong> Scene detection marks where the picture changes.</li>
<li><strong>Score the moments.</strong> Google Gemini reads the transcript and rates stretches of 15 to 60 seconds on whether they make sense alone and hold attention, then keeps the 3 to 15 best.</li>
<li><strong>Reframe to 9:16.</strong> Face tracking keeps the speaker in the frame; screen recordings and two-person shots get their own layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Subtitle and title.</strong> Captions are burned in from the transcript and each clip gets a hook and a title.</li>
</ol>
<p>That pipeline is the same whether you paste a link by hand or Autopilot starts
it. The details are on <a href="/how-openshorts-works">how OpenShorts works</a>.
Across all accounts, OpenShorts Cloud ran ${USAGE.jobs} clipping jobs on
${USAGE.minutes} minutes of source video between ${USAGE.window}; the median
source video was ${USAGE.median} minutes long.</p>

<h2>Autopilot: the channel clips itself</h2>

</figure>
<p>You connect your YouTube channel once. From then on Autopilot reads your
channel's uploads through the YouTube account you connected, so it also sees
videos you upload straight to YouTube, and it clips them through the normal
pipeline. The rules are deliberately conservative, because it spends your
plan's minutes while you are not looking:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only new videos.</strong> Switching it on never clips your back catalogue: only videos published after that moment, and only while they are at most 3 days old.</li>
<li><strong>One automatic video a day.</strong> If you publish three videos in a day, the others wait for you. You can still clip up to 5 more a day by hand from the same tab.</li>
<li><strong>A cap per video.</strong> Autopilot clips the first 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 or 90 minutes of each video (30 by default), so a three-hour stream cannot empty your plan.</li>
<li><strong>Shorts are skipped.</strong> A video that is already a Short is not clipped again.</li>
<li><strong>You get an email</strong> when the clips of each video are ready.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>Your latest uploads, what Autopilot did with each, and a "clip it" button for any of them. Titles and thumbnails blurred.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Autopublish: the best clips go out one a day</h2>
<p>Off by default. Turn it on and, for each video, Autopilot takes the 1 to 5
clips with the highest predicted score (3 by default) and schedules them one per
day at the hour you choose, in your own time zone, on the accounts you pick:
TikTok, Instagram and YouTube Shorts. TikTok clips arrive as drafts in your
TikTok inbox, so you open the app to post them. Leave autopublish off and you
review and post the clips yourself.</p>

<h2>What it costs</h2>
<p>Autopilot runs on your plan's minutes, so it is part of the paid plans and not
the free one. A 30-minute cap per video uses at most 30 minutes of your plan for
that video.</p>
${plansTable}
<p>The free plan still includes the clip generator itself: 20 minutes a month,
with a watermark, clipped by hand. Or self-host the
<a href="/open-source-video-clipper">open source video clipper</a> and wire the
same automation yourself with the
<a href="/n8n-youtube-shorts-automation">n8n workflow</a>.</p>

<h2>What it does not do</h2>
<ul>
<li>It only watches YouTube. Podcasts, Twitch VODs or files on your drive have to be pasted or sent through <a href="/automate-shorts-api">the API</a>.</li>
<li>It does not guarantee views. It picks the moments the model scores highest; some weeks those will be the wrong ones, which is why autopublish is off until you turn it on.</li>
<li>It is new: Autopilot launched on 22 September 2026.</li>
</ul>

    '"YouTube automation" means two different things. One is faceless channels that mass-produce videos from templates; YouTube demonetises that as inauthentic content. The other is taking the repetitive work off a real channel: cutting every long video into Shorts, writing the metadata, scheduling the posts. This page is about the second.',
    'With OpenShorts there are three ways to automate it: Autopilot in the app (no code), the n8n template (you approve each clip from Telegram), or the REST API and MCP server for your own scripts and for agents like Claude and ChatGPT.',
  ],
  body: `
<h2>What is worth automating on a YouTube channel</h2>
<p>The work that does not need your judgement, every single week:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cutting Shorts from each long video.</strong> Finding the moments, reframing to 9:16, adding subtitles. This is the slowest part to do by hand and the easiest to automate well.</li>
<li><strong>Posting them on a schedule</strong> to YouTube Shorts, TikTok and Instagram, one a day instead of all at once.</li>
<li><strong>The first draft of titles, descriptions and tags.</strong> You still edit them; the free <a href="/youtube-tag-generator">tag, title and description generator</a> writes the draft.</li>
<li><strong>Transcripts</strong> for show notes and blog posts, from the <a href="/youtube-transcript-generator">transcript generator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should stay yours: the long video itself, and the decision to publish.
YouTube's monetisation policy was changed on 15 July 2025 to name "inauthentic
content", which includes "AI-generated content made with generic or unoriginal
templates giving the impression of mass production". Automating the chores of a
channel you actually make is not that. Generating the channel is.</p>

<h2>Three ways to automate it, from no code to full control</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Route</th><th>Who it is for</th><th>You approve each post?</th><th>What you need</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="os">Autopilot</td><td>Creators who want it done, no setup</td><td>Your choice: autopublish on or off</td><td>A paid plan, your YouTube channel connected</td></tr>
<tr><td class="os">n8n template</td><td>People who already run n8n</td><td>Yes, from Telegram</td><td>n8n, an OpenShorts API key, a Telegram bot</td></tr>
<tr><td class="os">API and MCP</td><td>Developers and AI agents</td><td>Whatever your code decides</td><td>An API key, or a claude.ai / ChatGPT connector</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Route 1: Autopilot, no code</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to OpenShorts and open the <strong>Autopilot</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Connect your YouTube channel.</li>
<li>Switch Autopilot on, confirm you own the content, and choose how many minutes of each video to clip (10 to 90).</li>
<li>Optionally switch on autopublish: pick TikTok, Instagram and/or YouTube Shorts, how many clips per video (1 to 5) and the hour to post.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="shot">
<img src="/screens/autopilot-settings.webp" width="920" height="672" loading="eager"
     alt="The Autopilot settings in OpenShorts: connected channel, Autopilot on with a 10 minute cap, autopublish off.">
<figcaption>Autopilot in production, 23 September 2026. Channel name blurred.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From then on Autopilot looks at your channel about once an hour, starts a
job for each new upload it finds and emails you when the clips are ready. The exact rules (one automatic
video a day, only new videos, Shorts skipped) are on the
<a href="/auto-clip">auto clip page</a>.</p>

<h2>Route 2: the n8n template, with a human in the loop</h2>
<figure class="shot">
<img src="/n8n-content-machine-workflow.png" width="950" height="750" loading="lazy"
     alt="The OpenShorts content machine workflow open in n8n, from the channel trigger to Telegram approval and weekly analytics.">
<figcaption>The importable n8n workflow: watch the channel, clip, approve from Telegram, drip-publish, report weekly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run n8n, the free <a href="/n8n-youtube-shorts-automation">n8n YouTube
Shorts template</a> does the same job with one difference that matters: every
clip reaches your Telegram with Publish and Skip buttons, and nothing goes out
until you tap Publish. It reads your channel's public RSS feed, so it needs no
YouTube API key, and a self-hosted OpenShorts works too: change the base URL in
the workflow.</p>

<h2>Route 3: the API and MCP, for your own code and for agents</h2>
<p>Everything the app does is one HTTP call away. <code>POST /api/process</code>
takes a video URL and a <code>webhook_url</code>, and OpenShorts calls you back
once with the finished clips; the details and a working example are on
<a href="/automate-shorts-api">automate shorts with the API</a>. The same
pipeline is exposed as an MCP server, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or n8n's agent
node can clip and publish when you ask them in plain language.</p>
<figure class="shot">
<img src="/screens/connect-an-agent.webp" width="684" height="366" loading="lazy"
     alt="The connect an agent card in the OpenShorts account page, with setup steps for claude.ai and the MCP server URL https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp.">
<figcaption>Connecting Claude takes one URL: <code>https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp</code>. The card also has tabs for ChatGPT, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, n8n and curl.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>More on the tools the server exposes on the <a href="/mcp">MCP server page</a>.</p>

<h2>What it costs</h2>
<p>Autopilot, the API and MCP all use the same minutes as the app: 20 free
minutes a month on the free plan (Autopilot itself needs a paid plan), then
$12/month for 100 minutes, $29 for 300 or $59 for 750, as of 23 September 2026.
Self-hosting the MIT licensed code is free with no minute cap; you pay for your
own hardware and API keys.</p>
