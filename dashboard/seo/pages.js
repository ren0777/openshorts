<p>Yes, with one honest caveat. OpenShorts covers the same core job:
it takes a long video, finds the segments worth clipping, cuts them, reframes
them to 9:16 and burns in subtitles. It adds two things ${esc(c.name)} does not
have, AI voice dubbing into more than 30 languages and an AI UGC generator with
lip-synced actors. The caveat is that the free edition is self-hosted, which
means Docker and a machine to run it on. If you want a hosted product with no
setup, that is OpenShorts Cloud, and it is a paid service above 20 minutes a month.</p>

<h2>What does "free" actually mean here?</h2>
<p>Most tools marketed as free clip generators are free trials with a watermark
and a monthly cap. This one is different in a specific way that is worth stating
precisely, because the two editions are not the same offer.</p>
${pricingParagraph}
<p>The self-hosted edition has no watermark and no cap because there is no
metering code in it. It is the same pipeline the hosted service runs, released
under MIT, and you can read all of it.</p>

<h2>How do you generate clips from a long video for free?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository from GitHub and start it with <code>docker compose up --build</code>.</li>
<li>Create a Google Gemini API key. The free tier covers 1,500 requests a day, which is far more than a single creator uses.</li>
<li>Paste a YouTube link or upload a local file. Podcasts, webinars, livestreams, interviews and vlogs all work.</li>
<li>The pipeline transcribes, detects scenes, scores moments and returns 3 to 15 clips of 15 to 60 seconds each, already cropped to 9:16 with subtitles burned in.</li>
<li>Download them, or connect an account and post straight to TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What do you need to run it?</h2>
<p>Any machine with Docker. 8GB of RAM and a modern multi-core CPU is the
realistic floor. An NVIDIA GPU is optional and changes the numbers a lot: on CPU
an 8-minute video takes roughly 5 to 8 minutes to process, and on a GPU the same
video takes about 50 seconds. Linux, macOS and Windows via WSL2 all work, and
Docker Compose pulls Python 3.11, FFmpeg, YOLOv8, MediaPipe and faster-whisper
for you.</p>

<h2>Free AI clipper, free clipping AI, free clipping website: which one is this?</h2>
<p>All three searches mean the same job: something that watches a long video and
cuts the good parts into vertical clips without you paying. OpenShorts is that in
two forms. As a <strong>free clipping website</strong>, openshorts.app clips 20
minutes of video a month in the browser with no install and no credit card; the
clips carry a small watermark. As a <strong>free AI clipper you run
yourself</strong>, the same code from GitHub has no watermark and no monthly cap.
Either way the clipping AI is the same: Gemini picks the moments, face tracking
reframes them and the subtitles come from a word-level transcript. If you only
need one piece of that, the <a href="/tools">free tools</a> cover transcripts
and a 9:16 converter with no account at all.</p>

<h2>Is a free clip generator good enough for real posting?</h2>
<p>It depends on what you are comparing against. The moment detection uses the
same class of model the paid tools use, Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, and the
reframing uses MediaPipe with a YOLOv8 fallback and a stabiliser that holds the
camera still inside a safe zone rather than chasing every head movement. Where
the commercial tools are ahead is caption styling: they ship more presets and
more polish. If your clips live or die on animated caption design, budget for
that either in time or in a second tool.</p>

<h2>Why does this matter for reach?</h2>
<p>Short-form video delivers the highest ROI of any content format, according to
HubSpot's State of Marketing 2025 report, and 91% of businesses use video as a
marketing tool according to Wyzowl's 2025 Video Marketing Statistics. The
constraint for most people is not whether short video works, it is that cutting a
60-minute recording into 12 posts by hand takes longer than recording it did.</p>

<h2>Why self-host a video clipper at all?</h2>
<p>Three reasons come up repeatedly. The first is that unreleased footage,
client work and internal recordings should not be uploaded to a third party
whose retention policy you have not read. The second is cost at volume: a
per-minute cloud tool gets expensive quickly if you process long recordings
every week, whereas self-hosting costs electricity. The third is that the output
is opinionated, and if you disagree with how it reframes or where it cuts, having
the source means you can change it rather than file a feature request.</p>

<h2>What is in the pipeline?</h2>
${PIPELINE_STEPS.map((s) => `<h3>${esc(s.title)}</h3><p>${esc(s.body)}</p>`).join('')}

<h2>What does it run on?</h2>
<p>Docker Compose brings up the FastAPI backend and the React dashboard together.
The realistic floor is 8GB of RAM and a modern multi-core CPU; an NVIDIA GPU is
optional and takes an 8-minute video from roughly 5 to 8 minutes of processing
down to about 50 seconds. Linux, macOS and Windows via WSL2 are all supported.
Concurrency is controlled by a semaphore configured with MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS.</p>

<h2>What is the licence?</h2>
<p>MIT for the core application, which means you can use it commercially, modify
it and redistribute it. The <code>cloud/</code> directory, which contains
billing, managed keys and the hosted-service infrastructure, is carved out under
a separate commercial licence and is not needed to self-host.</p>

<h2>How does it compare to the closed-source tools?</h2>
<p>OpenShorts is the only open source option in this category. As of July 2026,
Opus Clip starts at $15/month, Submagic from $14/month, Vizard at $19.99/month
and Klap at $29/month, and none of them can be self-hosted or audited. The
trade-off is real in both directions: they ship more caption presets and require
no setup, and you cannot read a line of what they do with your video.</p>

<h2>The pipeline, stage by stage</h2>
${PIPELINE_STEPS.map((s) => `<h3>${esc(s.title)}</h3><p>${esc(s.body)}</p>`).join('')}

<h2>Why does moment scoring need the transcript and the scenes together?</h2>
<p>A transcript alone finds a good sentence but has no idea whether the shot cuts
halfway through it. Scene boundaries alone find clean cuts with nothing worth
saying between them. Passing both to the model at once is what lets it pick a
segment that is both quotable and visually intact, which is the difference
between a clip a person would watch and one that merely starts and stops in the
right places.</p>

<h2>Why does the camera hold still instead of following the face exactly?</h2>
<p>Because a crop that tracks a face frame by frame produces visible swinging,
and the swinging reads as amateur even when the framing is technically correct.
The reframing keeps a safe zone around the subject and only moves the crop when
they leave it, then damps the movement on the way. A speaker tracker sits on top
to stop the crop from flipping between people every time someone nods, and to
hold position through brief occlusions.</p>

<h2>How long does it take?</h2>
<p>On a typical CPU, an 8-minute source video takes roughly 5 to 8 minutes end to
end. On an NVIDIA GPU the same video takes about 50 seconds. The gap is almost
entirely transcription and encoding; the model call is a small fraction of it.</p>

<h2>Why every free clip generator adds a watermark</h2>
<p>A hosted clipping service pays for GPU time, transcription and model calls on
every video you process. The free tier exists to show you the output, and the
watermark exists so the output is not the product yet. That is not a scam, it is
the business model, and it is why searching for a hosted tool that is free,
unlimited and unwatermarked at the same time keeps returning nothing: the
combination cannot pay for itself. What a
<a href="/free-ai-clip-generator">free AI clip generator</a> can honestly offer
is one of the three, and which one depends on the edition.</p>

<h2>The structural exception: software you run yourself</h2>
${pricingParagraph}
<p>The self-hosted edition has no watermark for the same reason it has no usage
cap: there is no metering code and no watermark code in the pipeline at all. It
is not a trial build with limits switched off, it is the same MIT-licensed
source the hosted service runs, and you can read it line by line.</p>

<h2>What you trade for the self-hosted zero</h2>
<p>Honesty cuts both ways. Self-hosting costs you a machine and some patience:
8GB of RAM and a modern multi-core CPU is the realistic floor, and an 8-minute
video takes 5 to 8 minutes to process on CPU against about 50 seconds on an
NVIDIA GPU. You also bring your own Google Gemini API key, whose free tier
covers 1,500 requests a day. If none of that appeals, the hosted no-watermark
price is $12/month, and the comparison table above is what that buys elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Which "AI video generator" are you looking for?</h2>
<p>If you type this query wanting a model that produces footage from a text
prompt, you want a text-to-video model. If you have a podcast, webinar, stream
or interview recording and want short vertical videos out of it, you want a clip
generator. The two share almost no technology and no workflow. This page covers
both honestly and goes deep on the second, because that is what OpenShorts is.</p>

<h2>Open source text-to-video, briefly</h2>
<p>As of August 2026 the notable open-weight text-to-video models include
Genmo's Mochi 1 (Apache 2.0), Open-Sora, Tencent's HunyuanVideo and Alibaba's
Wan family. They genuinely generate novel footage, and they need data-center or
high-end consumer GPUs to run at usable speed. If that is your goal, start with
those projects; OpenShorts will not do it.</p>

<p>OpenShorts is not the only open source project in this space (it is also the
<a href="/free-ai-clip-generator">free AI clip generator</a> most of these pages
are about), and pretending otherwise would not survive one GitHub search. The notable neighbours:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-Youtube-Shorts-Generator</strong>: the most-starred repo in the category, with a leaner scope built around highlight extraction and cropping.</li>
<li><strong>supoclip</strong> and <strong>clippyme</strong>: smaller projects covering transcription-driven clipping, the latter also using Gemini for moment selection.</li>
<li><strong>MoneyPrinterTurbo</strong>: generates videos from text plus stock footage, which is a different job than clipping your own recordings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where OpenShorts differs from all of them is surface area: a web dashboard, a
REST API with keys, completion webhooks, an MCP server for agents, split-screen
and screencast layouts for two-person and screen-share footage, dubbing into 30+
languages, and direct publishing to TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.
If you want a small script you can read in an hour, the smaller repos are a
better fit, and that is a real recommendation rather than false modesty.</p>

  body: `
<h2>Why podcasts break naive clipping tools</h2>
<p>Podcast video is a conversation, and conversations move. A tool that crops a
fixed center column out of a wide two-shot shows whoever happens to sit in the
middle, which is often nobody. A tool that follows one face loses the reaction
shots that make clips work. Reviewers of the mainstream clippers consistently
report exactly this: framing that needs manual correction on multi-person
footage. It is not carelessness, it is that a single moving crop cannot show two
people at once.</p>

<h2>How the two-speaker layout works</h2>
<p>OpenShorts detects when a scene is a genuine two-shot, meaning both faces are
visible in the same frame for at least half of the sampled frames. That test
matters: it is what separates a real side-by-side conversation from
shot/countershot editing, where a naive split would show the same person twice.
Confirmed two-shots render as a split layout, both speakers stacked in
half-frames filling the 9:16 canvas. With speaker cutting enabled the clip
instead hard-cuts to whoever is talking, with mouth activity normalised per
speaker so that lighting and contrast differences do not hand the whole scene to
one side of the table.</p>

<h2>From episode to posted clips, step by step</h2>
<ol>
<li>Paste the episode's YouTube link or upload the file. Podcasts of an hour or more are the normal case, not the limit.</li>
<li>faster-whisper transcribes with word-level timestamps, and PySceneDetect maps the cuts.</li>
<li>Google Gemini reads the transcript against the scene boundaries and returns the 3 to 15 segments that stand alone best, 15 to 60 seconds each.</li>
<li>Each segment is reframed for its content: split layout for two-shots, face tracking for single speakers, screencast layout if the episode shares a screen.</li>
<li>Subtitles are burned in from the word-level transcript, and finished clips post directly to TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, or come back through the API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What a full episode costs to clip</h2>
<p>Credit-metered tools bill on the length of the video you import, not on the
clips you keep. As of August 2026, a 60-minute episode costs 60 credits at Opus
Clip or Vizard whether it yields 5 usable clips or 20, and a weekly show at that
length runs past the entry plans of both. OpenShorts prices the other way
around:</p>
${pricingParagraph}

<h2>What about audio-only podcasts?</h2>
<p>OpenShorts clips video. If your show is audio-only, the pipeline has nothing
to reframe, and tools that generate waveform audiograms serve that case better.
The moment you record video, even a static two-camera setup, everything on this
page applies.</p>

<h2>How to convert a YouTube video into Shorts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Paste the video's URL. OpenShorts fetches it directly; there is no download-then-upload round trip through your machine.</li>
<li>The video is transcribed with word-level timestamps and scanned for scene boundaries.</li>
<li>Google Gemini scores the transcript against the scenes and picks the 3 to 15 segments most likely to stand alone, 15 to 60 seconds each.</li>
<li>Each segment is cropped to 9:16 with face tracking, or a split or screencast layout when the content calls for it, and subtitles are burned in.</li>
<li>Download the clips, or post them straight to YouTube Shorts, TikTok and Instagram Reels from the dashboard or the API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why starting from the link matters</h2>
<p class="checked">Competitor terms checked 2026-08-04 on public pricing pages.</p>
<p>Most long videos worth clipping already live on YouTube, so a converter that
only accepts uploads adds a detour: fetch the file with a downloader, wait,
re-upload gigabytes, wait again. It also decides who can use the free tier at
all. As of August 2026, Opus Clip's free plan accepts uploads only, with link
import reserved for paid plans. OpenShorts accepts links on every tier,
including both free ones, because the fetch step costs the pipeline almost
nothing and the detour costs you the most time of any step.</p>

<h2>What comes out the other end</h2>
<p>Vertical 9:16 clips of 15 to 60 seconds with word-level subtitles burned in,
each with an AI-written title and description ready for the platform. The
reframing follows the content: a single speaker is face-tracked with a
stabiliser that holds the camera still instead of chasing every head movement, a
two-person conversation renders as a stacked split layout, and screen shares
keep the screen legible instead of cropping it to ribbons.</p>

<h2>Whose videos can you convert?</h2>
<p>Yours, and those you have permission for. Your own uploads, your podcast
guests' episodes with their blessing, client channels you manage, licensed or
public-domain footage. Clipping someone else's video without permission is a
copyright question OpenShorts does not answer for you, and platforms remove
reuploads that fail it. The tool fetches what you point it at; the rights are
your call and your responsibility.</p>

       "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/hooks/openshorts",
       "webhook_secret": "your-shared-secret"}'</code></pre>
<p>The response returns a job id immediately. Minutes later, when the clips are
cut, subtitled and archived, OpenShorts POSTs once to your webhook URL with the
job outcome, clip titles and download links durable enough to fetch later. A
failed job also fires the webhook, so your pipeline never hangs on silence.</p>

<h2>Verifying the webhook</h2>
<p>If you passed a <code>webhook_secret</code>, the request carries an
<code>X-OpenShorts-Signature</code> header of the form
<code>sha256=&lt;hex&gt;</code>: the HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body under
your secret. Recompute it and compare in constant time:</p>
<pre><code>expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret, raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
hmac.compare_digest(expected, request.headers["X-OpenShorts-Signature"])</code></pre>
<p>Reject anything that does not match and you have closed the door on forged
deliveries.</p>

<h2>Using it from n8n, Zapier or Make</h2>
<p>No dedicated node is needed: the flow is a generic HTTP Request step that
POSTs to <code>/api/process</code>, then a Webhook trigger that receives the
completion payload and fans out to whatever comes next, posting to socials,
dropping links in Slack, logging to a sheet. The two-step shape above is the whole integration, which is why generic
nodes cover it. There is now also an importable
<a href="/n8n-youtube-shorts-automation">n8n workflow</a> that wires the whole
loop, including channel watching, Telegram approval and scheduled publishing.</p>

<h2>A weekly pipeline in one cron line</h2>
<p>Because the API is one POST, scheduling is whatever scheduler you already
have. A cron job that submits the latest episode URL every Monday, a GitHub
Action on your podcast repo, or an agent that watches a feed. The webhook does
the second half, so nothing stays running in between. If you would rather not
write the curl, the CLI wraps it:</p>
<pre><code>uvx openshorts process "$EPISODE_URL" \\
  --webhook https://your-server.com/hooks/openshorts \\
  --webhook-secret "$SECRET"</code></pre>

<h2>What automation costs</h2>
<p>API and MCP calls draw from the same minute balance as the dashboard. There
is no per-call price, no separate API tier and no automation surcharge. As of
August 2026 that is not the market default: the mainstream tools meter their
APIs per source minute or per operation, on top of subscription tiers, so an
always-on pipeline runs with a taxi meter attached. Self-hosted OpenShorts has
no meter of any kind, and the hosted plans are flat:</p>
${pricingParagraph}

<h2>Agents instead of scripts</h2>
<p>If the thing driving the pipeline is an AI agent rather than a script, the
same account exposes a native MCP server with six tools covering process,
status, clips, quota, subtitles and publishing. The endpoint, the tool table and
client setup live on the <a href="/mcp">MCP server and API page</a>.</p>

     alt="The OpenShorts content machine open in n8n: four labelled stages, from the daily channel RSS trigger through the clipping call, the Telegram approval buttons and the weekly analytics digest.">
<figcaption>The whole machine is one canvas: watch the channel, clip, approve from Telegram, drip-publish and measure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This workflow runs a YouTube channel on its own without handing over the
publish button. Once a day it reads your channel feed, clips one video into
vertical shorts, and sends each finished clip to your Telegram with Publish and
Skip buttons. What you approve is scheduled one post per day to the accounts you
connected, and every Sunday it reports back what the published clips actually
did. Two credentials, no polling loop, no TikTok or Instagram OAuth app.</p>

<h2>Download the workflow</h2>
<p>The JSON lives in the project repository, not behind an email form:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="${SITE.repo}/blob/main/examples/n8n/openshorts-content-machine.json" rel="noopener">openshorts-content-machine.json</a> — the full four-stage machine described below.</li>
<li><a href="${SITE.repo}/blob/main/examples/n8n/openshorts-clip-and-notify.json" rel="noopener">openshorts-clip-and-notify.json</a> — the minimal version: a form takes a video URL, a signed webhook returns the clips.</li>
<li><a href="${SITE.repo}/tree/main/examples/n8n" rel="noopener">Setup notes</a> — credentials, the webhook secret, and the known limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In n8n: <strong>Workflows → Import from file</strong>, then fill in your channel
id and chat id where the sticky notes on the canvas say so.</p>

<h2>What the workflow actually does</h2>
<p>Four stages, all on one canvas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Watch the channel.</strong> A daily schedule trigger reads
<code>youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=...</code>, which needs no YouTube
API key, and picks one video: your newest upload, or if there is nothing new,
the next unprocessed video from your back catalogue. One video a day keeps the
minute burn predictable, and a 402 (out of minutes) pauses the machine with a
Telegram notice instead of failing silently.</li>
<li><strong>Clip, then get called back.</strong> One HTTP request to
<code>/api/process</code> carrying a <code>webhook_url</code>. When the job
ends, OpenShorts POSTs once with the finished clips and durable download links.
There is no Wait node anywhere in the workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Approve from your phone.</strong> Each 9:16 clip arrives in Telegram
as a video message with Publish and Skip buttons. A human approves every post,
which is also what separates this from the fully automated pipelines that
YouTube's inauthentic-content policy targets.</li>
<li><strong>Drip-publish and measure.</strong> Approved clips take the next free
daily slot and post to the accounts you connected in OpenShorts. Every Sunday
the workflow reads back the analytics of what it published and sends you
impressions, per-platform split and your best post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why posting does not need TikTok or Instagram credentials</h2>
<p>The usual wall in an n8n video workflow is the publishing half: TikTok
requires an audited app to post publicly, and the Instagram Graph API refuses
anything that is not a public static URL, which is why Google Drive links fail
there. This workflow sidesteps both by posting through
<code>POST /api/social/post</code> against the networks you connected once in
your OpenShorts account. The workflow itself holds no social credentials, and
the clip file is already on durable storage, so the public-URL requirement is
satisfied before Instagram ever sees it.</p>

<h2>Scheduling that does not double-book</h2>
<p>Approving two clips seconds apart used to be enough to publish them at the
same minute: each execution read the same in-memory counter before either wrote
back. The workflow now asks the server for the queue it actually holds
(<code>GET /api/social/scheduled</code>) and picks the first free slot from it,
which is shared state and cannot race with itself that way. The same endpoint,
plus <code>DELETE /api/social/scheduled/{job_id}</code>, is how you inspect or
cancel a post before it goes out.</p>

<h2>What it costs to run</h2>
${pricingParagraph}
<p>API calls draw from the same minute balance as the dashboard: no per-call
price, no automation surcharge, and no meter at all on the self-hosted edition.
Telegram bots are free, and n8n runs wherever you already run it.</p>

<h2>Known limits, before you find them the hard way</h2>
<ul>
<li>Telegram previews a video by URL up to about 20 MB; larger clips arrive as a
link message carrying the same approval buttons.</li>
<li>A YouTube channel RSS feed exposes only the latest 15 videos, so the
back-catalogue drip reaches back that far and no further.</li>
<li>The Telegram Trigger node needs your n8n to have a public https URL, because
Telegram registers a webhook against it. A laptop-local n8n can run every other
stage, but the approval buttons need a deployed instance or a tunnel.</li>
<li>Workflow static data, where the machine remembers which videos it already
processed, only persists on production executions. Test runs from the editor do
not advance it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prefer an agent to a workflow?</h2>
<p>The same account exposes an MCP server, so Claude, ChatGPT or an n8n AI Agent
node can drive the pipeline as tools instead of fixed steps. That surface is
documented on the <a href="/mcp">MCP server and API page</a>, and the raw REST
loop on the <a href="/automate-shorts-api">automation page</a>.</p>

${faqBlock([
  {
    q: 'Is there a free n8n template to turn long videos into shorts?',
    a: 'Yes. OpenShorts publishes an MIT-licensed n8n workflow that clips a YouTube channel automatically and posts the approved clips to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.

Most clipping tools now have an API, and Opus Clip added an MCP server in July 2026, but they meter agent calls per source minute or per operation. OpenShorts API calls draw from the same flat minute balance as the dashboard, and the self-hosted edition, free and MIT-licensed, serves the same MCP endpoint with no meter at all.',
  ],
  body: `
<h2>What can an agent actually do with OpenShorts?</h2>
<p>Everything the dashboard does. The MCP server is not a wrapper around a
subset of features: each tool calls the same pipeline the web app uses, with the
same account, the same minutes and the same job history. An agent can take a
YouTube URL, turn it into 3 to 15 vertical clips with word-level captions,
restyle those captions, and publish or schedule the result to TikTok, Instagram
Reels and YouTube Shorts.</p>

<h2>How do I connect Claude or ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>With the URL alone. The server implements OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client
registration, which is what claude.ai and ChatGPT expect from a remote MCP
server, so there is no key to copy:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>claude.ai:</strong> Settings, Connectors, Add custom connector, paste <code>https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp</code>, Connect.</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Settings, Connectors, Create, paste the same URL, choose OAuth.</li>
<li>Approve the access on openshorts.app (sign in if you are not). The 8 tools appear in every chat, and the connection is listed under Account, API keys, where revoking it disconnects the app.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do I connect Claude Code, Cursor or n8n?</h2>
<p>CLI and workflow clients take an API key instead: create one in your account
page (shown once, starts with <code>osk_</code>) and pass it as a Bearer
token. With Claude Code:</p>
<pre><code>claude mcp add --transport http openshorts https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp \\
  --header "Authorization: Bearer osk_..."</code></pre>
<p>Any client that speaks Streamable HTTP works the same way: the endpoint is
<code>https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp</code>, the server describes itself over
the protocol, tool schemas included, and the account page has copy-ready
snippets for Claude Desktop, Cursor, n8n and curl.</p>

<h2>What tools does the MCP server expose?</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tool</th><th>What it does</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><code>process_video</code></td><td>Starts clipping a video from a URL or an upload_id. Returns a job id immediately; processing takes minutes. Pass captions: false when the source already has subtitles burned in, auto_hook: false to skip the hook line (on by default).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>create_upload</code></td><td>Reserves an upload slot for a local file: the agent PUTs the bytes to the returned URL, then processes it by upload_id.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>get_job_status</code></td><td>Progress, recent log lines, and the clips once the job completes.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>list_clips</code></td><td>Titles, durations, platform-ready descriptions and download URLs for a finished job.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>get_quota</code></td><td>Plan and remaining minutes, so an agent can check before starting a large job.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>add_subtitles</code></td><td>Restyles the burned-in captions of one clip: presets (default, hormozi, pill, lime, oneword, clean), size, word-by-word reveal, a box behind the active word or one word at a time.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>publish_clip</code></td><td>Posts or schedules one clip to TikTok, Instagram or YouTube through the connected account.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In clients that support the MCP Apps extension (ChatGPT apps, mcp-ui hosts),
<code>list_clips</code> also renders as an interactive clip picker: preview each
9:16 clip inline, select the keepers and publish them without leaving the
conversation. Clients without UI support see the same data as plain results.</p>

<h2>How does this compare to the other clipping tools' agent access?</h2>
<p class="checked">Checked 2026-08-04 on vendor developer documentation and pricing pages. This market is moving fast; verify before committing a pipeline.</p>
<p>Agent access stopped being exclusive in 2026: Opus Clip launched its own MCP
server in July, Reap ships MCP plus a CLI, and Klap, Vizard and Submagic have
REST APIs. A comparison that pretended otherwise would not deserve your trust.
What still separates the offerings is how agent calls are billed and where the
server can run:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Tool</th><th>MCP server</th><th>REST API</th><th>How agent calls are billed</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="os">OpenShorts</td><td class="os yes">Yes, hosted and self-hosted</td><td class="os yes">Yes, with signed webhooks</td><td class="os">Same flat minute balance as the dashboard; self-hosted has no meter</td></tr>
<tr><td>Opus Clip</td><td class="yes">Yes, since July 2026</td><td>Yes</td><td>Credits per source minute, expiring in 60 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reap</td><td class="yes">Yes, plus CLI</td><td>Yes</td><td>Subscription from $9.99/month, metered minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Klap</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Per operation, roughly $0.32 to $0.48 each</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vizard</td><td>No</td><td>Yes, with webhooks</td><td>Consumes plan upload minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Submagic</td><td>No</td><td>Yes, Business tier ($69/month)</td><td>Metered per minute on top of the tier</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The consequence for an autonomous pipeline is simple: an agent loop on a
metered API runs with the bill still attached to every decision it makes. On a
flat plan the worst an agent can do is spend your minutes; on the self-hosted
edition there is nothing to spend. For the recipe-shaped version of this,
webhooks, n8n and cron, see <a href="/automate-shorts-api">automating shorts
with the API</a>.</p>

<h2>Can I use a plain REST API instead of MCP?</h2>
<p>Yes. The same <code>osk_</code> key authenticates against the REST API, and
interactive documentation lives at
<a href="https://api.openshorts.app/docs" rel="noopener">api.openshorts.app/docs</a>
with the OpenAPI spec at <code>/openapi.json</code>. A processing job is one
request:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST https://api.openshorts.app/api/process \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer osk_..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...", "acknowledged": true,
       "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/hooks/openshorts"}'</code></pre>

<h2>Is there a CLI?</h2>
<p>Yes, a zero-dependency one on PyPI. It talks to the same REST surface as
everything else, so the terminal, the dashboard and the agents can never
disagree about what a job did:</p>
<pre><code>pip install openshorts   # or: uvx openshorts

export OPENSHORTS_API_KEY=osk_...
openshorts process "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --wait
openshorts clips &lt;job_id&gt;
openshorts publish &lt;job_id&gt; 0 --platforms tiktok,youtube</code></pre>
<p>Point <code>OPENSHORTS_API_URL</code> at <code>http://localhost:8000</code>
and the same binary drives a self-hosted instance with no key.</p>

<h2>How do completion webhooks work?</h2>
<p>Pass <code>webhook_url</code> when starting a job and OpenShorts sends
exactly one POST when the job finishes or fails, with clip titles and download
links in the body. Add a <code>webhook_secret</code> and the body is signed with
HMAC-SHA256 in the <code>X-OpenShorts-Signature</code> header so your receiver
can verify the sender. This is what lets an n8n, Zapier or cron pipeline run
without a polling loop.</p>

<h2>Does this work on the self-hosted edition?</h2>
<p>Yes. The self-hosted edition serves the same <code>/mcp</code> endpoint on
your own machine, with no API key required because there is no account system:
it follows the same bring-your-own-key rules as the rest of the self-hosted app.
Point your MCP client at <code>http://localhost:8000/mcp</code> and the same six
tools appear.</p>

<h2>What does it cost?</h2>
${pricingParagraph}
<p>API and MCP calls are not billed separately: they draw from the same minute
balance as the dashboard, so automation does not change the price of anything.</p>

<h2>How Opus Clip's credit system works</h2>
<p>The unit Opus Clip bills in is not the clip. It is the minute of video you

<p>That single design decision is what makes the plans hard to compare against
each other, and why the tiers below cost what they cost. If your sources are
short (a 60-second TikTok you want restyled) the meter barely moves. If they are
long (a 90-minute interview, a weekly show) the meter is the whole bill, and the
number of clips you keep never enters into it.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Plan</th><th>What it includes</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>${tierRows}</tbody>

<h2>What does the free plan include?</h2>
<p>60 minutes of source video a month, 720p exports and a watermark. Two details
that the pricing table states and the marketing copy tends to bury: free-plan
exports leave Opus Clip's storage after three days, and link import (pasting a
YouTube URL instead of uploading a file) is a paid-plan feature as of August
2026. If your source is already on YouTube, the free plan may not reach it.</p>

<h2>Is there a free trial?</h2>
<p>As of ${esc(OPUS.checked)} the pricing page lists a free tier rather than a
time-boxed trial. When people search for an "Opus Clip free trial" they are
usually describing that free tier, or looking for a way to test the unwatermarked
output before paying. The distinction matters: a trial expires and the free tier
does not, but neither one removes the watermark.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="label">The cheapest honest test</span><p>The
watermark is the thing you are trying to evaluate past. If the question is
whether the pipeline is good enough for your footage, a self-hosted run on one

<h2>What "free" means at each tool</h2>
<p>Free is doing a lot of work in this category. Three different things are
being sold as free: a metered tier that watermarks, a trial that expires, and
software you run yourself that has no meter in it at all. Only the third one
stays free when your usage grows.</p>

<p class="checked">Opus Clip free-tier terms checked 2026-08-04; OpenShorts
Cloud terms are ours and current.</p>

<h2>The first free route: run it yourself</h2>
<p>Clone the repository, run <code>docker compose up --build</code>, add a
Google Gemini API key (its free tier covers 1,500 requests a day) and paste a
link. Nothing is metered because there is no metering code: the same pipeline
the hosted service runs, MIT-licensed, on your hardware. Source video never
leaves the machine, which is the other reason people choose this route.</p>
<p>What it costs you instead: Docker, 8GB of RAM as a realistic floor, and time.
An 8-minute video takes roughly 5 to 8 minutes to process on CPU and about 50
seconds on an NVIDIA GPU. For a weekly podcast that is a coffee break; for
twenty videos a day it is a job.</p>

<h2>The second free route: the hosted free tier</h2>
<p>If you would rather not run anything, ${esc(EDITIONS.cloud.name)} gives you
${EDITIONS.cloud.freeMinutes} minutes a month with a watermark and no credit
card, and it accepts a pasted YouTube link on that tier. Paid plans from
$${EDITIONS.cloud.lowPrice}/month drop the watermark. It is a smaller allowance
than Opus Clip's free tier and it does not try to hide that.</p>

<h2>When paying is the honest answer</h2>
<p>If you process hours of source video every week and have no machine to spare,
the flat plan is cheaper than either free tier is convenient. What is worth
avoiding is paying a per-minute credit meter for long sources: as of
${esc(OPUS.checked)} a 60-minute episode consumes 60 credits at Opus Clip no
matter how many clips you keep, and a weekly show at that length runs past the
entry tier's allowance by the second episode of the month.</p>

<h2>Is Opus AI the same thing as Opus Clip?</h2>
<p>Yes. The product is marketed as Opus Clip and served from <code>opus.pro</code>,
and "Opus AI" is how a large share of its traffic searches for it. There is no
second, separate Opus AI clipper; if you see the name in a listicle, it is this
tool under a shorter spelling.</p>

also the name of an Anthropic language model. That is a different thing entirely

opus.pro.</p></div>

<h2>What Opus AI does</h2>
<p>It takes a long video, finds the segments worth keeping, cuts them, reframes
them vertically and burns in captions with a large library of animated styles.
The differentiators its users cite are the caption presets and the virality
score, which is trained on the company's own data rather than on a
general-purpose model. It is cloud only: there is no self-hosted edition and no
source to read.</p>

<p>The differences between Starter and Pro that people actually notice are
1080p instead of 720p, auto-posting straight to the connected accounts, speaker
detection and the brand kit. The minutes are the headline, and the resolution
step is the one that shows up on a phone screen.</p>

<h2>Who the Pro tier is priced for</h2>
<p>Opus bills one credit per minute of video imported, not per clip exported.
A weekly 60-minute show is roughly 260 source minutes a month, which fits inside
Pro and does not fit inside Starter. A creator posting one 20-minute video a week
uses about 90 minutes and is paying $14/month more than the job needs. The plan
is priced for volume of input, so the honest question is how many minutes you
actually import, not how many clips you publish.</p>

<h2>What OpenShorts costs for the same job</h2>
${pricingParagraph}
<p>Two differences are worth stating plainly rather than leaving to a table.
Self-hosted has no meter at all, so a 90-minute interview and a 9-minute one cost
the same: nothing. Hosted is a flat minute balance with no per-call or per-clip
charge, and API and MCP usage draws from the same balance as the dashboard.</p>
<p>What you give up: the caption-style library. Opus Clip's presets are more
numerous and more polished than ours, and if animated captions are the product
you are selling, that is a reason to stay. What you gain: the code is MIT and
auditable, the source video can stay on your machine, and dubbing into 30+
languages is in the same pipeline rather than a second tool.</p>

<h2>What "video to text" means in a clipping tool</h2>
<p>Three different outputs get described as video to text, and they are not
interchangeable. A <strong>transcript</strong> is the words with timestamps. A
<strong>subtitle file</strong> is the same words shaped for playback, cut into
readable lines. A <strong>summary or article</strong> is a written document
generated from the words, which is a language-model task sitting on top of the
transcript rather than a transcription task at all.</p>
<p>When a clipping tool advertises video to text, it means the first two. They
fall out of the transcription pass the tool has to run anyway to find the good
moments, which is why they are bundled rather than sold.</p>

<h2>What Vizard gives you</h2>
<p>Vizard runs the whole thing in the browser and treats the timeline as the
product: it transcribes the upload, lets you edit the captions and the clip
boundaries on a timeline, and exports both the clips and the text. Multi-language
subtitles are one of its stronger features. Its entry plan starts at
${esc(c.entryPrice)}, and the free plan allows 120 upload minutes and 10 exports.</p>
<p>${esc(c.gotcha)}</p>

<h2>Doing the same thing with OpenShorts</h2>
<p>OpenShorts transcribes with faster-whisper and keeps a timestamp for every
word, not every sentence. Word-level timing is what makes the subtitle file
land on the right frame and what lets the clip boundaries fall inside a sentence
instead of at the nearest one. The transcript is returned with the finished job
next to the clips, and the burned-in captions are cut from it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-hosted:</strong> free, MIT-licensed, no watermark, no cap. Transcription runs locally, so the audio never leaves your machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hosted:</strong> 20 free minutes a month with no credit card, then flat plans from $12/month with no watermark.</li>
<li><strong>Via API or MCP:</strong> the transcript and the clips come back from the same job, so an agent can summarise the text without a second transcription bill.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which one should you pick?</h2>
<p>If you want to hand-correct captions on a timeline before exporting, Vizard's
editor is the better fit and it is not close. If you want the text as a
by-product of clipping at volume, or you need the transcript to stay on your own
machine, self-hosted OpenShorts is free and the transcript comes with the job.</p>

<h2>What Submagic is for</h2>
<p>Submagic styles captions. You bring a clip you have already chosen and cut,
it transcribes or takes your transcript, and it burns in animated, well-designed
captions with emoji and keyword highlighting. That is a narrower job than the
clippers it gets compared against, and it does that narrower job better than they
do.</p>

<h2>What the reviews consistently praise</h2>
<p>The caption library and the speed on short inputs come up in almost every
public review. That is not a coincidence: the product is not doing moment
detection, scene analysis or reframing, so all of its engineering sits in front
of the one thing it sells. If caption design is the reason you are shopping, the
recommendation is straightforward and it is not ours.</p>

<h2>What it does not do</h2>

<p>Concretely: no moment detection, no scene-boundary awareness, no 9:16
reframing with subject tracking, and no source-video privacy story because it is
a cloud service. It also cannot be self-hosted, so a per-video meter is the only
way to buy it.</p>

<p>Every tier is metered in videos per month, which is the pricing shape that
punishes a podcast: you pay per finished video rather than per source minute, so
the cost scales with how much you publish.</p>

<h2>The honest summary</h2>
<p>Submagic is the right buy if you already cut your own clips and want the
captions done well. It is the wrong buy if you are starting from long-form video,
because you would be paying twice: once for the clipper that finds the moments
and once for the captions. OpenShorts does both halves in one pipeline, and where
it loses is exactly the axis Submagic wins on.</p>

<h2>Why GTA clips break a normal auto-clipper</h2>
<p>Every auto-clipper in this category was designed around a talking head: one
person, centred, filling a 16:9 frame that crops cleanly to 9:16. A GTA stream
is the opposite on all three counts. The frame is gameplay, so a centre crop
keeps Los Santos and drops the minimap, the kill feed and the chat. The only
face is a small webcam box pinned to a corner, so a face tracker either ignores
it or, worse, latches onto a pedestrian NPC. And the source is not eight minutes
long, it is eight hours. Those are three different problems and each one has its
own answer below.</p>

<h2>How the webcam inset layout works</h2>
<p>The OBS layout almost every GTA streamer uses, gameplay full screen with the
camera composited into a corner, is a single video file with two things in it.
OpenShorts detects that geometrically rather than asking a model: it looks for a
subject that is <strong>small</strong>, <strong>off centre horizontally</strong>
and <strong>still between samples</strong>. All three filters are needed. A
talking head sitting high in frame is still centred, so size alone is not
enough, and a real person moves 300 pixels between samples where a pinned
webcam box moves three to eleven. On our 48-video test corpus that detector
found all five clips that had a webcam inset, with no false positives.</p>
<p>When it fires, the clip renders as INSET: the gameplay across the full width
at the top of the 9:16 frame, and the webcam box cropped out and blown up to
fill the bottom. You get the play and the reaction to the play, both legible on
a phone, instead of one of them at 100 pixels wide.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="label">Why not just ask the model</span>
<p>Offered as a fourth choice alongside the other layouts, Gemini answered
"screencast" on all five clips that had an inset, in two separate passes, and
overall layout accuracy fell from 92% to 83-85%. The geometry is a better judge
than the model here, so the detector runs after the layout decision rather than
inside it.</p></div>

<h2>When the gameplay itself is the point</h2>
<p>Not every moment has a face worth showing. A chase, a heist finale or a
five-car pileup means what it means across the whole width of the frame, and
cropping to a vertical column deletes the half that explains it. OpenShorts
measures how wide the meaningful content is and routes on that: content spanning
more than 85% of the frame renders as WIDE, which keeps the full width intact
over a blurred backdrop rather than side-cropping it. Content that leaves room
beside it, a GTA RP scene playing out on one side of the screen for instance,
gets stacked over the presenter instead.</p>
<p>Width is the gate rather than coverage because width is what survives
measurement. A corner kill notification and a full-screen map both look "busy";
only one of them spans the frame and cannot be cropped.</p>

<h2>How to clip a GTA 5 stream, step by step</h2>
<ol>
<li>Paste the VOD link (a Twitch export, a YouTube upload) or drop the local recording in. Multi-hour sources are the normal case here, not the edge case.</li>
<li>faster-whisper transcribes with word-level timestamps and PySceneDetect maps the cuts, which is what keeps a clip from opening mid-explosion.</li>
<li>Gemini reads the transcript against those boundaries and returns the 3 to 15 segments that stand alone best, 15 to 60 seconds each.</li>
<li>Leave the vertical layout on <strong>auto</strong> (dashboard, advanced options; <code>"layouts": ["auto"]</code> on the API). Auto is what enables the screen layouts, and the inset detector is chained behind them.</li>
<li>Subtitles are burned in from the word-level transcript. On gaming feeds this is not optional polish: the clips autoplay muted.</li>
<li>Download the clips, or post them straight to TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels from the dashboard or the API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What an eight-hour stream costs to clip</h2>
<p class="checked">Competitor terms checked 2026-07-27 on public pricing pages.</p>
<p>This is the arithmetic that decides the category, and it is worth doing
before you pick a tool. Credit-metered clippers bill one credit per minute of
the video you <em>import</em>, not per clip you keep. One eight-hour GTA RP
stream is 480 minutes. Opus Clip's free tier is 60 minutes a month, Starter is
150 minutes at $15/month and Pro is 300 minutes at $29/month, so a single
stream does not fit in any of them, and a streamer who goes live three times a
week is importing roughly 6,000 minutes a month. Gaming is the category where
per-minute pricing and the actual shape of the content are furthest apart.</p>
${pricingParagraph}

<h2>What happens when nobody is talking</h2>
<p>Most of this page assumes commentary, because the default picker reads the
transcript: roleplay dialogue, heist banter and party voice chat are exactly
what it is good at, and reading words rather than frames is why an eight-hour
source costs about the same to analyse as an eight-minute one. A silent grind
has no transcript to read, so OpenShorts does not use one.</p>
<p>It switches paths on its own, and it does not need to be told to. Footage
with no audio track at all, and footage whose transcript comes back under 8
words or under 5 words per minute (music-only streams, a mic that was muted the
whole session), both trip the same branch: the video itself goes to Gemini,
which watches it and returns the same 3 to 15 moments in the same 15 to 60
second band as the transcript path. Everything downstream is identical, layouts
and inset detection included. The one difference is that the clips come out
without captions, which is correct rather than a bug: there is no speech to
caption.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="label">The one ceiling worth knowing</span>
This is the single stage that sends Gemini the footage instead of a handful of
frames, and Gemini bills video at roughly 300 tokens per second. An hour of
gameplay is around 1.08 million tokens, which does not fit a 1 million token
context window, and there is no length guard in front of it: a silent eight-hour
VOD will fail at the model rather than politely. So for silent footage, hand it
the session or the segment you care about rather than the full stream. With
commentary the ceiling does not exist, because the transcript path never uploads
the video at all.</p>

<h2>Whose footage can you clip?</h2>
<p>Yours, and footage you have permission for. Your own streams and recordings,
your RP server co-stars' VODs with their blessing, clients' channels you manage.
Two separate rights questions apply to GTA clips and they have different
answers: the <strong>recording</strong> belongs to whoever streamed it, and the
<strong>game footage</strong> is covered by Rockstar Games' own policy on fan
videos, which has historically permitted gameplay videos monetised through the
platforms' standard ad programs. That is their policy and it can change, so
check the current version rather than taking this page's word for it. Reuploading
another streamer's clips without permission is the one case that is clearly not
fine, and the platforms strike it.</p>
