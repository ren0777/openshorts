"""Opting out of the emails we send that are commercial communications.

Most messages OpenShorts sends are service notices: a sign-in link, "your
clips are ready", "your free clips are deleted tomorrow", "your account has been
deleted". ``send_out_of_minutes_email`` and the lifecycle emails
(cloud/lifecycle.py) are not — they sell a plan, which makes them a
comunicación comercial under LSSI art. 21. Art. 21.2 permits them to an
existing customer for a similar product, but only if *every single message*
offers a simple, free way to refuse: ``emails.send_commercial_email`` adds the
footer link and the ``List-Unsubscribe`` header, and skips opted-out accounts.

The link has to work with no session (the reader is in their mail client, not
the app) and must never expire, so it carries an HMAC of the user id keyed on
the app's JWT secret. That token proves nothing except "the holder was sent an
email addressed to this account", and the only thing it can do is set the flag
— it cannot read anything, and it cannot re-subscribe anyone.
